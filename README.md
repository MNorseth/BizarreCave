Project #2 - Bizarre Cave Problem

Team Name: MGM
Team Members: Mauricio Macias, Mitchell Norseth, Gabriel Rivera

Intro: For this project we used a brute force algorithm that will traverse the cave by randomly choosing moves available, but forcing the limitations upon each movement. The program starts at coordinate (16,0,0) and when the coordinate (8,1,7) is reached by the program it will end.
